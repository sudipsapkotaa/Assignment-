        <p>In this report, I will share my experience of learning the basics of web development and the process of
            designing, coding and debugging a website. Throughout the module, I had ups and downs and faced many
            challenges, but the experience has been valuable in developing my skills.</p>

        <div class="section-heading">(っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ Technical and Design Development ♥</div>
        <p>Over the course of the module, I developed a website using HTML and CSS. The website focuses on showcasing my
            skills and experience, with a clean and minimalistic design that is easy to navigate. To achieve this, I
            chose a colour scheme that is simple and easy on the eyes, with a font that is clear and easy to read.</p>
        <p>In the early stages of development, I found it challenging to understand the technicalities of web
            development, but I gradually became more comfortable with coding and debugging. Through online tutorials and
            classes, I learned how to structure and style web pages, as well as how to incorporate responsive design.

        <p>Overall, I found the module to be challenging, but also extremely rewarding. I gained a better understanding
            of web development, and the process of coding, designing and debugging. I learned how to structure web pages
            using HTML and style them using CSS. I also gained an understanding of the importance of designing for a
            positive user experience.</p>

        <div class="valid">
        <p>Throughout the development of my website, I frequently checked the validation reports to ensure that my pages
            were HTML and CSS validated. Here are the screenshots of my validation reports:</p>
