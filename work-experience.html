            <h3>
                I worked at MICROSOFT for 2 year
            </h3>
            <p>During my professional journey, I was fortunate enough to work with Microsoft for a span of two years.
                This
                experience was pivotal in shaping my career and skill set, as I had the chance to be part of exciting
                projects
                and
                collaborate with experts in the industry who were passionate about technology and innovation.
                Working at Microsoft allowed me to develop my skills in software development, project management, and
                teamwork,
                which proved to be invaluable in my future endeavors. It taught me the importance of creativity,
                innovation,
                and
                perseverance when pursuing new ideas, and also helped me navigate challenges and setbacks in a resilient
                and
                adaptable manner.</p>
            <p>Overall, I consider my time at Microsoft as a significant and enriching experience, and I am grateful for
                the
                opportunity to have worked with such an innovative and talented company.</p>

                <h1 align="center">Responsibility</h1>
            </i>

            As a software engineer at Microsoft, my primary responsibility would have been to develop and maintain
            software
            applications and systems that meet the needs of the company and its customers this have would include
            collaborating with other engineers, project managers, and stakeholders to understand requirements and
            design
            specification for new feature or products. Writing high quality efficient and maintainable code using
            languages
            such as C++, c#, or java, testing, and debugging code to ensure it worked correctly and met quality
            standards,
            contributing to the design and architecture of software systems, and staying up-to-date with new
            technologies
            and
            industry trends to ensure our software remained current and competitive. Additionally, I would have been
            expecting
            to communicate progress and issue to project managers and stakeholders working in an agile development
            environment
            and timely delivery of software products.</pa>
